How the Lie derivative relates to Cartan's magic formula, results directly from the definition of the Lie derivative for smooth functions:
\[\mathcal{L}_Vf(p)  = df_p(V_p) = Vf(p)\]
i.e.
\[\mathcal{L}_Vf  = Vf\]
Similarly, we can write
\[V \lrcorner(df) + d(V \lrcorner f) = V \lrcorner df = df(v) = Vf\]
thus stating that they coincide.
